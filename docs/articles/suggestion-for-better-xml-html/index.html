                        <p class="pml-paragraph">As shown in this article, the answer to this question is a resounding &quot;Yes, we can!&quot;.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">We'll have a look at a suggestion for a new syntax that is less verbose, easy to read and write, and works well for all kinds of XML documents, including HTML code.</p>

                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Before trying to invent anything new we should of course first have a deep look at what exists already.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">This chapter answers the question: Is there any existing markup language with a more human-friendly syntax than XML/HTML, but also well suited for big, complex, and changing documents?</p>

                            <h3 class="pml-chapter-title">JSON</h3>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">In the last years, JSON has overtaken XML in terms of popularity.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">To understand why (in the context of <i class="pml-italic">syntax</i>), let's have a look at a simple data structure in JSON:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>{
    &quot;person&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Albert&quot;,
        &quot;married&quot;: true,
        &quot;address&quot;: {
            &quot;street&quot;: &quot;Kramgasse&quot;,
            &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Bern&quot;
        },
        &quot;phones&quot;: [ &quot;123&quot;, &quot;456&quot;]
    }
}    </code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">In XML, the code could look like this:</p>
                            <pre id="albert_example" class="pml-code"><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;person&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Albert&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;married&gt;true&lt;/married&gt;
    &lt;address&gt;
        &lt;street&gt;Kramgasse&lt;/street&gt;
        &lt;city&gt;Bern&lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;/address&gt;
    &lt;phones&gt;
        &lt;phone&gt;123&lt;/phone&gt;
        &lt;phone&gt;456&lt;/phone&gt;
    &lt;/phones&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Many people prefer the JSON syntax. It is easier to read and less verbose than the XML version. Not counting indentation spaces, the above JSON code requires 144 characters to type. The XML code has 276 characters. That's an increase of 92%!</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Examples like the above one lead to an intriguing question:</p>
                            <ul class="pml-list">
                                <li class="pml-list-element">
                                    <p class="pml-paragraph">&quot;Couldn't we just stop using XML and use JSON instead for everything?&quot;</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">For example, could we use the JSON syntax to write HTML documents?</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Let's try.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Here is a simple HTML snippet:</p>

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">In JSON, we could express this as follows:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>{ &quot;p&quot;: &quot;foo bar&quot; }</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Let's write <code class="pml-inline-code">foo</code> in <i class="pml-italic">italics</i>, and <code class="pml-inline-code">bar</code> in <b class="pml-bold">bold</b>.</p>

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Now we want to display everything in red:</p>

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">We can prettify to make the code easier to read:</p>

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">But now the HTML one-liner has mutated into a '14 lines monster with lots of horizontal and vertical whitespace'.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Not quite what we are looking for.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Besides the obvious fact that the complexity of the JSON code increases quickly, there is another worrying observation:</p>

                                <li class="pml-list-element">

                                </li>
                                <li class="pml-list-element">
                                    <p class="pml-paragraph">In the second example, the value becomes a JSON array: <code class="pml-inline-code">&quot;p&quot;: [...]</code>.</p>

                                <li class="pml-list-element">
                                    <p class="pml-paragraph">In the last example, it mutates to a JSON object: <code class="pml-inline-code">&quot;p&quot;: {...}</code>.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Such changes can easily lead to maintenance nightmares. Code that inspects the data structure must be updated each time the code changes. For example if we wanted to extract the text of element <code class="pml-inline-code">p</code>, we would need to write different code for the three cases.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">XML doesn't have this problem. The content of <code class="pml-inline-code">p</code> is always a list of child elements.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">At this point you hopefully agree that we can stop further investigation and move on. The JSON syntax is a bad fit for describing markup code like HTML documents in a human-friendly way. That doesn't mean of course that 'JSON is bad'. JSON is a good choice in many cases. It is a native part of Javascript, well supported in most programming languages, and there are lots of libraries and tools available for JSON. However, in the context of our search for a better markup syntax, JSON (as well as all variations of it) is not an option. Later on we'll have a look at a more complete HTML example that confirms our conclusion.</p>

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">One way to minimize verbosity is to use indentation to define structure. <a href="https://yaml.org/" class="pml-link">YAML</a> is probably the most popular language that uses this technique.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Here is a reprint of a JSON example we saw previously:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>{
    &quot;person&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Albert&quot;,
        &quot;married&quot;: true,
        &quot;address&quot;: {
            &quot;street&quot;: &quot;Kramgasse&quot;,
            &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Bern&quot;
        },
        &quot;phones&quot;: [ &quot;123&quot;, &quot;456&quot;]
    }
}    </code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">In YAML, this becomes:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>person:
    name: Albert
    married: true
    address:
        street: Kramgasse
        city: Bern
    phones:
        - 123
        - 456</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Nice!</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Easy to read and write.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">At first sight it might seem that we could use such a noise-less syntax for all kinds of data structures, including markup code.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">It turns out that would be a very bad idea. The problem with YAML and all other languages that use indentation to define structure is this: It works well for small, simple structures (such as config files). But if we need to manage big documents with deeply nested structures then it quickly becomes error-prone and unmaintainable.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Moreover, while using indentation to define structure effectively reduces verbosity, it also leads to much more lines of code for certain types of documents. The reason is that each child element <i class="pml-italic">must</i> be written on a new line.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">To illustrate this, let's see how the simple HTML one-liner we used in the previous chapter would be written in YAML. Here is a reprint of the HTML:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;p style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;foo&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;bar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">In YAML the code would look like this:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>p:
    style: 'color:red;'
    content:
        - i: foo
        - ' '
        - b: bar</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">There are other arguments against whitespace-sensitive documents, such as the problems with mixing spaces and tabs, and code snippets that cannot be shared between different documents with different levels of indentation. These inconveniences are well known - there is no need for repetition here.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Finally, the whitespace-significant approach forces us to use whitespace according to the rules (which can get very complex). It takes away the freedom to use whitespace to make documents more appealing and understandable.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">As for JSON, this doesn't mean that 'YAML is bad'. YAML is well suited in <i class="pml-italic">some</i> cases. What I want to say is that the idea of using whitespace-sensitivity in a markup language like HTML is doomed to fail. It's understandable that, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#History_and_name" class="pml-link">Wikipedia</a>, the meaning of the acronym YAML was changed from &quot;Yet Another Markup Language&quot; to &quot;YAML Ain't Markup Language&quot;.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">XML/HTML ignores whitespace, and that's the right choice.</p>

                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In this chapter I will suggest a new, alternative syntax for XML/HTML documents. The new syntax should be practical for humans and machines.

                                <h4 class="pml-chapter-title">Simple Element</h4>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Let's start with the following HTML snippet - a simple element that contains only text:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;i&gt;foo&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">The first thing we need to do is to get rid of the closing tag syntax (<code class="pml-inline-code">&lt;/i&gt;</code>) - the biggest culprit of XML's verbosity. We can do this by just closing the element with <code class="pml-inline-code">&gt;</code>, like this:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;i&gt;foo&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">This creates an imbalance of <code class="pml-inline-code">&lt;</code> and <code class="pml-inline-code">&gt;</code> symbols. But that's easy to fix. We replace the <code class="pml-inline-code">&gt;</code> in the opening tag with a space - the easiest character to read and write on any keyboard. The code becomes:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;i foo&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Let's think about the brackets. We could use <code class="pml-inline-code">&lt;&gt;</code>, as in XML/HTML. But there are other options: <code class="pml-inline-code">[]</code>, <code class="pml-inline-code">{}</code>, and <code class="pml-inline-code">()</code>. We need to consider two points:</p>
                                <ul class="pml-list">
                                    <li class="pml-list-element">
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">How easy are they to type?</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph"><code class="pml-inline-code">[]</code> clearly wins, because on most keyboards (including Dvorak keyboards) all other brackets require the <code class="pml-inline-code">Shift</code> key to be hold down.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="pml-list-element">
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">How often do they occur in normal text?</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">This is important because the brackets have to be escaped in normal text. I didn't find any reliable statistics, but my guess would be that <code class="pml-inline-code">()</code> is used often, while the others are used rarely, maybe in this order: <code class="pml-inline-code">{}</code>, <code class="pml-inline-code">[]</code>, and <code class="pml-inline-code">&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">The best option is to use <code class="pml-inline-code">[]</code>, because this pair is easy to write (no need for <code class="pml-inline-code">Shift</code> on most keyboards), and square brackets occur rarely in normal text. Moreover, it creates a clear distinction between the new pXML syntax (<code class="pml-inline-code">[]</code>), XML/HTML (<code class="pml-inline-code">&lt;&gt;</code>), and source code (which often uses <code class="pml-inline-code">{}</code>).</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Hence the final pXML code becomes:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>[i foo]</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">... which is easier to read and write than:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;i&gt;foo&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Another advantage of the new syntax is that bracket matching in text editors (available in most modern versions) becomes more useful. In the case of XML/HTML, the <code class="pml-inline-code">&lt;</code> of the opening tag matches only the <code class="pml-inline-code">&gt;</code> of the <i class="pml-italic">opening</i> tag, which is of little use. In VSCode it looks like this:</p>

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">In pXML the <code class="pml-inline-code">[</code> of the opening tag matches the <code class="pml-inline-code">]</code> of the <i class="pml-italic">closing</i> tag, which is much more helpful, especially in case of elements with lots of nested content.

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Obvious options like <code class="pml-inline-code">[/tag]</code> or <code class="pml-inline-code">tag]</code> don't work, because they create an imbalance of brackets, or they require special rules for exceptional corner cases. I finally opted for the following alternative syntax:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>][/tag]</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Hence the above code to close three elements can optionally be written like this:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>][/img] ][/div] ][/section]</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">... or this</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>        ][/img]
    ][/div]
][/section]</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">This is a bit more verbose than the XML syntax, because there is one more character per closing tag. But it is also a bit easier to write because the <code class="pml-inline-code">Shift</code> key doesn't have to be used twice. In practice the verbose syntax is only needed to close big tags with many levels of child elements. So I think the alternative pXML syntax to close tags is a good compromise. It's there if you need it, and it works well (no corner cases that require special rules).</p>

                                <h4 class="pml-chapter-title">XML Attributes</h4>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Besides elements, XML also supports <i class="pml-italic">attributes</i>. Here is an example of an XML element with attributes:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;div id=&quot;unplug_warning&quot; class=&quot;warning big-text&quot;&gt;Unplug power cord before opening!&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">XML doesn't specify when to use attributes instead of elements. However, it's considered <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd_el_vs_attr.asp" class="pml-link">good practice</a> to use attributes only for <i class="pml-italic">metadata</i> (data about data). All <i class="pml-italic">data</i> should be stored in child-elements.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Here is an reprint of a simple data structure we saw in a <a href="#albert_example" class="pml-xref">previous</a> chapter:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;person&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Albert&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;married&gt;true&lt;/married&gt;
    &lt;address&gt;
        &lt;street&gt;Kramgasse&lt;/street&gt;
        &lt;city&gt;Bern&lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;/address&gt;
    &lt;phones&gt;
        &lt;phone&gt;123&lt;/phone&gt;
        &lt;phone&gt;456&lt;/phone&gt;
    &lt;/phones&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">We <i class="pml-italic">could</i> use attributes for some data and rewrite the code like this:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;person name=&quot;Albert&quot; married=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;address street=&quot;Kramgasse&quot; city=&quot;Bern&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;phones&gt;
        &lt;phone&gt;123&lt;/phone&gt;
        &lt;phone&gt;456&lt;/phone&gt;
    &lt;/phones&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">However we should not do that if we follow the general advice that attributes should be used for <i class="pml-italic">meta</i>data. Clearly, <code class="pml-inline-code">name</code>, <code class="pml-inline-code">married</code>, <code class="pml-inline-code">street</code>, and <code class="pml-inline-code">city</code> are <i class="pml-italic">not</i> metadata, they are data.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">In practice, people sometimes use attributes for data because it reduces verbosity (as can be seen in the above example) or maybe because they are not aware of the general advice. Searching the net for 'xml elements vs attributes' reveals that there is <i class="pml-italic">a lot</i> of confusion, as shown <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33746/xml-attribute-vs-xml-element" class="pml-link">here</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1096797/should-i-use-elements-or-attributes-in-xml" class="pml-link">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-eleatt/index.html" class="pml-link">here</a>, for example.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">HTML code like the following one is fine, because the attribute is used to store metadata:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;redOnYellow&quot;&gt;Good News!&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">It is important to note that we <i class="pml-italic">could</i> also use an element for <code class="pml-inline-code">class</code> (thereby violating the advice):</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;class&gt;redOnYellow&lt;/class&gt;Good News!&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">In the first draft of this article, attributes were supported in pXML. The above XML example:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;div id=&quot;unplug_warning&quot; class=&quot;warning big-text&quot;&gt;Unplug power cord before opening!&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">... would be written like this in pXML:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>[div ( id=unplug_warning class=&quot;warning big-text&quot; ) Unplug power cord before opening!]</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">As shown, attribute assignments were embedded in parenthesis (which is familiar to many programmers), and attribute values without spaces didn't need to be quoted (e.g. <code class="pml-inline-code">id=unplug_warning</code>).</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Right after I finished the chapter about pXML attributes, I leaned back and asked myself: &quot;Do we really <i class="pml-italic">need</i> attributes?&quot;.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">One of the best general advice for good engineering popped up in my mind:</p>
                                <blockquote class="pml-quote">

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">After playing around with some examples, I concluded: &quot;No, we do not need attributes!&quot;.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">So let's be bold. Let's remove attributes. We don't need them. As we'll see soon, we'll reap some nice benefits from doing so.</p>

                                <h4 class="pml-chapter-title">Separation of Data And Metadata</h4>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">What we <i class="pml-italic">need</i> is a separation of metadata and data, because that's sometimes very useful (and heavily used in HTML to style documents). However, we don't need <i class="pml-italic">attributes</i> to make that separation. We can just use <i class="pml-italic">elements</i> to store metadata. We only need to find a way to distinguish elements that contain metadata from those who contain data. I finally opted to use the character <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code> as a name prefix for elements containing metadata. The reason for this choice is that we can think of <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code> as <i class="pml-italic">different</i> (not equal). Metadata are <i class="pml-italic">different</i> from data, so <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code> is easy to remember. Moreover, according to the XML <a href="#name_rules" class="pml-xref">naming rules</a> (which are also applied in pXML) <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code> is not allowed in a name. Hence there is no clash, no ambiguity.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">As a result, the following HTML code:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;redOnYellow&quot;&gt;Good News!&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">... is written like this in pXML (note the <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code> prefix for <code class="pml-inline-code">class</code>):</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>[span [#class redOnYellow]Good News!]</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Yes, this might look unappealing at first - especially for people used to look at HTML code for years.</p>

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">For example, the value of an XML attribute can only be a string. In pXML, metadata can also be stored as a structure (tree of values) which means:</p>

                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Say we have the following XML attribute:</p>
                                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>style = &quot;color: blue; font-family: Arial; background-color: inherit;&quot;</code></pre>

To achieve this we would need to write a mini-parser that extracts the value. Not a trivial task if it needs to work well in all variations of defining the <code class="pml-inline-code">style</code> attribute.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In pXML <code class="pml-inline-code">style</code> could be defined like this:</p>

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">As said already in chapter <a href="#XML_attributes" class="pml-xref">XML Attributes</a> there is a lot of confusion in the XML world about when to use attributes and when to use elements.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Sometimes attributes are used while the correct way would be to use elements, or vice-versa. If the mistake is fixed later, all code that accesses the data must be updated too, because XML attributes have a different API than elements. Moreover, entities used to escape characters might need to be adapted too, because the rules for escaping characters in attributes and elements are different. This can turn into a frustrating and error-prone process.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">In pXML there is no such confusion, because data and metadata are all stored in elements.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">The temptation to use attributes to reduce verbosity vanishes too and doesn't make sense anymore, because the number of markup characters for pXML elements is the same as for XML attributes. Example:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>XML element:   &lt;identifier&gt;123&lt;/identifier&gt;
XML attribute: identifier=&quot;123&quot;
pXML element:  [identifier 123]</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">There is only one question that arises in pXML: &quot;Is this value data or metadata?&quot;. If it is metadata then the element's name should be prefixed with <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code>. That's it. If the initial choice was wrong, it can easily be changed later. No need to worry about escaping, and less API changes.</p>

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Here are some points to consider:</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph"><br /> <b class="pml-bold">1. New markup symbol</b></p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">A new markup symbol (<code class="pml-inline-code">#</code>) has been added.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">However, this symbol can only appear as a prefix to an element name. Therefore there is no need to escape <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code> in text.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Moreover, we have also <i class="pml-italic">removed</i> three markup symbols: <code class="pml-inline-code">=</code>, <code class="pml-inline-code">&quot;</code>, and <code class="pml-inline-code">'</code>. And there is no more need to escape <code class="pml-inline-code">&quot;</code> or <code class="pml-inline-code">'</code>.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph"><br /> <b class="pml-bold">2. XML/pXML gap</b></p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Removing attributes increases the gap between XML and pXML. But the impact is less severe than it might seem at first.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">The basic concept of separating data and metadata remains the same.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">It is still easy to convert pXML to XML and vice versa.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">However, there is an incompatibility issue that arises when pXML code is converted to XML (e.g. read into an XML DOM or converted to XML code) <i class="pml-italic">and</i> pXML metadata uses structured data (not only strings). The issue arises because XML attributes support only strings. Some workarounds to consider could be:</p>
                                <ul class="pml-list">
                                    <li class="pml-list-element">

                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">If needed, the distinction between data and metadata in XML elements could be made by using a specific prefix or suffix for the element name. For example <code class="pml-inline-code">#class</code> in pXML becomes <code class="pml-inline-code">_class</code> in XML (according to the <a href="#name_rules" class="pml-xref">rules</a> XML element names can start with an underscore).</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Alternatively, one could add an attribute (or child-element) to flag an element as metadata, e.g.</p>

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">An XML comment looks like this:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;!-- text of comment --&gt;</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">We can simplify by using <code class="pml-inline-code">[-</code> to start a comment, and <code class="pml-inline-code">-]</code> to stop it. Here is the pXML version:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>[- text of comment -]</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">There is no ambiguity with <code class="pml-inline-code">[-</code> being the start of an element with name <code class="pml-inline-code">-</code> because, according to the <a href="#name_rules" class="pml-xref">rules</a>, an element name cannot contain hyphens (<code class="pml-inline-code">-</code>).</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph"><i class="pml-italic">Nested</i> comments are often useful in practice. For example, it's common to comment a block of code that contains already a comment. Therefore pXML supports nested comments (unlike XML). Here is an example:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>[- text of outer comment
    [- text of inner comment -]
-]</code></pre>

                                    <p class="pml-paragraph">Applications that convert pXML to XML code must be careful to not convert inner comments, because XML doesn't support nested comments. The above comment cannot be converted to:</p>
                                    <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;!-- text of outer comment

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">When I started to ponder about the new syntax, I didn't think at all about creating a better XML/HTML syntax. What I <i class="pml-italic">wanted</i> was a new syntax to write articles (published on a blog) and books. Initially I used Docbook, then Asciidoctor to write articles. I also tried out Markdown, and had a look at other syntaxes like RestructedText. To make a long story short: I felt frustrated with some impracticabilities of existing solutions, and finally decided to design a new syntax called <i class="pml-italic">Practical Markup Language (<b class="pml-bold">PML</b>)</i>. If you want to know more about my motivation to create PML, you can read <a href="https://www.pml-lang.dev/docs/articles/practical-document-markup-language/index.html" class="pml-link">We Need a New Document Markup Language - Here is Why</a> (published in March 2019). (Note: For readers still using a word processor, I also wrote <a href="https://www.pml-lang.dev/docs/articles/advantages-markup-language-vs-word-processor/index.html" class="pml-link">Advantages of Document Markup Languages vs WYSIWYG Editors</a>)</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Nowadays I write all my articles in PML (including this one). To publish them I created a <i class="pml-italic">PML to HTML Converter</i> which reads a PML file and creates a HTML file. You can have a look at the PML source of this article <a href="https://github.com/ppl-lang/blog/tree/main/2021-03-Suggestion_for_better_XML_HTML/PML_source" class="pml-link">here</a>, and you can see the original version of it <a href="https://www.ppl-lang.dev/blog/suggestion-for-better-xml-html/index.html" class="pml-link">here</a> (i.e. the result produced by the <i class="pml-italic">PML to HTML Converter</i>). Right-click on the original article, and click 'View Page Source' if you want to have a look at the HTML code produced by the <i class="pml-italic">PML to HTML Converter</i>. The converter produces indented, clean and simple HTML code, like hand-coded. The <i class="pml-italic">PML to HTML Converter</i> is open-sourced under the GPL2, and written in <a href="https://www.ppl-lang.dev" class="pml-link">PPL</a> (<i class="pml-italic">Practical Programming Language</i>). The source code is on <a href="https://www.github.com/pml-lang/converter" class="pml-link">Github</a>.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">After creating PML, I suddenly realized that it's syntax could also be used to write XML/HTML documents - a nice side effect. This article is my first step in making my idea public.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">One could say that PML is to pXML like HTML is to XML. PML uses the pXML syntax, but only predefined, sematic PML tags are allowed. PML still use attributes, but I want to change that in the future.</p>

                            <h3 class="pml-chapter-title">Lenient Syntax in PML</h3>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">An important aspect of PML is the parser's ability to work in <i class="pml-italic">lenient mode</i>. This mode supports very targeted syntax simplifications, aiming to eliminate as much &quot;noise&quot; as possible. It should be as easy as possible to write articles and books in PML. Here is an example to illustrate the advantage of the <i class="pml-italic">lenient syntax</i>:</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Below is the code of a simple PML document, written in strict pXML:</p>
                            <pre class="pml-code"><code>[document [title Test]
    [chapter [title An Unusual Surprise]
        [paragraph Look at the following picture:]
        [img [src images/strawberries.jpg]]
        [paragraph Text of paragraph 2]
        [paragraph Text of paragraph 3]
    ]
]</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">In lenient PML mode (always activated), the text can be shortened to:</p>
                            <pre id="pml_lenient_example" class="pml-code"><code>[doc Test
    [ch An Unusual Surprise
        Look at the following picture:
        [img images/strawberries.jpg]
        
        Text of paragraph 2

        Text of paragraph 3
    ]
]</code></pre>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Let's briefly see how this works:</p>
                            <ul class="pml-list">

                                    <p class="pml-paragraph">Most PML tags have alternative short names, besides their standard, more verbose name (e.g. <code class="pml-inline-code">doc</code> instead of <code class="pml-inline-code">document</code>, <code class="pml-inline-code">p</code> instead of <code class="pml-inline-code">paragraph</code>, <code class="pml-inline-code">ch</code> instead of <code class="pml-inline-code">chapter</code>, etc.)</p>

                                    <p class="pml-paragraph">Some elements (for example <code class="pml-inline-code">chapter</code> and <code class="pml-inline-code">image</code>) have one so-called <i class="pml-italic">default child-element</i>.

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">There are different ways to do this in XML. It's typically done like this:</p>

                            <p class="pml-paragraph">The most verbose syntax is XML (especially in case of long parameter names). The least verbose one is pXML with only 2 markup characters per parameter. Less noise implies 'easy to read and write for humans'.</p>

                        <p class="pml-paragraph">As demonstrated, it <i class="pml-italic">is</i> possible to simplify the XML syntax and make it more accessible for humans.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">The pXML syntax introduced in this article essentially suggests two improvements:</p>
                        <ul class="pml-list">
                            <li class="pml-list-element">
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Replace the XML syntax:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;name&gt;value&lt;/name&gt;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">... with:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>[name value]</code></pre>
                            </li>
                            <li class="pml-list-element">
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Remove attributes and use the <code class="pml-inline-code">#</code> element name prefix to make a distinction between data and metadata.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">The XML code:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>name = &quot;value&quot;</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">... becomes:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code>[#name value]</code></pre>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">The following picture illustrates the simplification achieved with pXML:</p>
                        <figure style="text-align: center">
                            <img alt="From XML to pXML" class="pml-image" src="images/n_v.png" width="400" />
                        </figure>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Although the pXML syntax is less verbose and less complex, it does not make XML less powerful. Once a pXML document is parsed into an XML tree, the whole set of great additions that are part of the XML ecosystem can still be used: documents can be validated, queried, modified, and transformed.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">pXML also adds two features not supported in XML:</p>
                        <ul class="pml-list">
                            <li class="pml-list-element">
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Metadata can contain structured data, instead of just strings.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="pml-list-element">
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Comments can be nested.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Well designed syntax increases productivity, reduces errors, eases maintenance, and improves space and time efficiency.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Syntax matters!</p>
